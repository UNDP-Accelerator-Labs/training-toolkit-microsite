# Using design thinking to design public products or services 

## What it does.  
This tool enables you to apply design thinking, one of the most used methods for public innovation, to design or improve public products or services in collaboration with users, particularly those from vulnerable contexts. Design thinking is a user-centered approach that prioritizes placing the user at the center of the design process. This is because the individuals who will ultimately use the product or service are the ones who best understand the necessary features to meet their needs, desires, and expectations. 

## Value proposition for the government/other partner.  
Applying design thinking enables national and local governments to:  
(1) strengthen their capacities in public innovation through hands-on experience;  
(2) ensure that the responses are genuinely relevant and effective by gaining a deep understanding of the specific needs of users;  
(3) design cost-effective solutions;  
and (4) foster closer citizen-government relationships by establishing a collaborative and co-creative work routine.
